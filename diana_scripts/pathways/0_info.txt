###### GET aCRD aCRD TRANS ASSOCIATIONS

In gwork, TRANS folder:
- we have trans CRD-CRD significant associations.
look into the run.sh how they are called, using CLOMICS trans which takes as input Hi-C values

But confusing because if we look at 7_analyse_gene_CRD_association.R plotting file then it adds HiC data to the trans
CRD associations and plots in HiC_support_gene_CRD_associations.pdf. In this case he would have used QTLTOOLS trans to
obtain the associations. BUT it is CRD-gene cis associations supported by HiC. we do not call trans here

QUESTION: should we also look at the sCRD-sCRD associations?


###### COMPUTE TRHs

We get the TRHs from /Users/dianaavalos/Programming/IMMUNE_CELLS/diana_scripts/trans/TRHIndex_3_cell_types.R using the
 igraph algo. Haven't looked in depth at how it works and tuning of parameters.

Weird:

get mapping_gene_CRD_mean_ALL_70.txt

Why both with different size?? 70 vs 70 much smaller, 8000 to 5000 rows :s
